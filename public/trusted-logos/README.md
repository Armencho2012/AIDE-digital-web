# Trusted Logos

Current source of truth:

```bash
python3 scripts/fetch_trusted_logos.py
```

This downloads and writes:

- `logo-01.png`
- `logo-02.png`
- ...
- `logo-16.png`

If you want to split from a custom collage image instead, you can still use:

```bash
python3 scripts/extract_trusted_logos.py
```
